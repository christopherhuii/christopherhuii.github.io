    This challenge was increidbly painful for me. I'm not sure what happened, but my pair and I were not sure how to accomplish the challenge. Since we weren't making any progress, we decided to take a break in order to gather our ideas. After we resumed, things picked up much quicker. We understood what the challenge was about and we had a clear vision on how to accomplish it. I also learned that taking a little break could make a big difference after you've become flustered. I understand the Learning Competencies, but I need more practice to refine these skills. It took a lot of trial and error to get the website to look like the way my partner and I wanted. Overall, I think I need to review this challenge and look at the material again to understand it better
