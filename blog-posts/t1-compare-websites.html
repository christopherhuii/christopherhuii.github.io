      <h1 id="blog-title">Blog #1: My Favorite Websites</h1>
      <p id="blog-date">8/30/2014<br><!--Time here-->1:36PM</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><!--Insert one paragraph here-->The internet is a wonderful thing. It provides a bridge to the rest of the world we are not immediately in contact with. With only a few clicks, I could see the latest news in the Middle East and with another click I could be looking at the latest RoR developments. We currently live in a time where the internet and the world wide web are almost necessary to survive. Out of all the webpages I’ve visited, my favorites tend to be very minimalistic. With that said, there are tons of different webpages to explore and I have narrowed down my favorites to only three. Three of my favorite websites include Reddit, Netflix, and the Dev Bootcamp webpage!
</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><!--Insert another paragraph here!-->If you have never visited Reddit in your life, I would recommend being extremely careful before visiting it. After you visit Reddit, it might take over your life. I can easily spent 2-3 hours on Reddit in a blink of an eye. Reddit is described as the “front page of the internet”. Reddit is website where users are able to post the latest developments and happenings in the world. The possibility of topics that one can post is endless. Posts are categorized into “subreddits”, which are essentially “category” tabs. For example, the NBA subreddit will hold the latest information that is happening in the NBA and the World News subreddit will have a bunch of links and news about the happenings in the world. Reddit makes it extremely convenient for people to find all the news and information they need on one website.</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><!--Insert another paragraph here!-->Reddit’s user interface is extremely minimalistic. That is something I like compared to other websites. Other websites are filled with graphics and advertisements, which drown the actual content of the websites. Reddit has a simple title, which you can click on to reach the content, and under that, are all the different user’s comments about the content. If you create an account, the navigation bar on top is completely customizable, so you can access the subreddits you are closest with quickly. It might take a little while to get used to, but after you fully understand the website, the information on Reddit is endless. I can honestly say that I have become a more intelligent person after spending time reading Reddit! </p>
      <p class="paragraph"><!--Insert another paragraph here!-->My second favorite webpage is Netflix. I’m pretty sure most of you have heard of and have used Netflix, but let me explain to you why I appreciate it so much. For those of you who don’t know, Netflix is a webpage where subscribers have access to streaming TV shows, movies, documentaries, and more. At first glance of the homepage, there are very neatly organized rows of pictures of media. Each row is categorized with either “Recently Watched”, Things you would like”, “Horror”, “Comedy”, etc. This makes it extremely convenient for a subscriber to find something to watch. It also makes it convenient to discover new shows and movies that you are interested in! When you hover over each show, Netflix gives you a brief description of the show and shows the actors/actresses that are in it. The webpage isn’t overly cluttered with information. It is rather minimalistic only showing pictures and a very small amount of text. I am attracted to websites that are minimalistic, instead of cluttering a page with tons of content. Netflix is a great website for people that are looking for a place with a simple design to watch their favorite shows. </p>
      <p class="paragraph"><!--Insert another paragraph here!-->The third webpage I decided on was the Dev Bootcamp website. I’m not trying to suck up to anybody, but a part of the reason why I decided on Dev Bootcamp over other schools was because of the webpage. When you first arrive at the webpage, visitors are greeted by a video. It is a great introduction giving future students a great idea what the program is about. The navigation bar is extremely convenient. Each page on the website is filled with information and is very pleasing to the eyes. The content is easy to read compared to the other school’s I’ve seen. Even though the pages were not minimalistic, the content was organized in a way where I felt it was minimalistic. Not only was the webpage pleasing to the eyes and easily navigable, but the content was spot on! The content gave me all the information I needed to make the decision to attend Dev Bootcamp. The website contained most the information I used to make the decision to attend Dev Bootcamp. The website’s content “sold” me on attending Dev Bootcamp, which is why I am writing today!</p>
