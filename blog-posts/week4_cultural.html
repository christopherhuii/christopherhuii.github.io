      <h1 id="blog-title">Blog #7: Issues in Tech</h1>
      <p id="blog-date">9/18/2014<br>6:04 PM</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>Disclaimer: I realize this issue is not an issue about the technology industry itself, but rather it is an issue created by technology put upon people. Sorry if this doesn’t meet the requirements of the assignment.</strong> </p>
      <p class="paragraph">I had a background in Economics and Finance  before making the switch over the technology industry. Long story short, I decided to switch over to the technology industry because I want to build stuff. I want to be able to make applications and make things that are useful in everyday life. Prior to starting Dev Bootcamp, the only programming experience I had was the Codecademy track on Ruby. This is all to show that my experience and technology sector is very limited. Even though there tech industry is relatively new to me, there was always one problem I saw in technology. The problem with technology is itself. </p>
      <p class="paragraph">Yes, you read that correctly. Go ahead and reread it again and let it digest a little. The problem with technology is itself. </p>
      <p class="paragraph">I remember days as a child playing handball and basketball with friends during my free time. Today, kids are so focused on playing games on portable devices. Their eyes are fixed on the screen, not saying a word to each other. I also remember when talking over the phone was necessary for communication because texts weren’t unlimited. Today with iMessage and unlimited texting, talking on the phone is rare and we all hide behind the words of a text message. </p>
      <p class="paragraph">The problem with technology is that it separates people from real and personal communication. People are so consumed with games like Candy Crush and Angry Birds. People would rather spend their time playing games instead of going out and meeting up with friends. Teenagers and young adults are caught up with texting instead of healthy human interaction. The number of apps in circulation allowing people to waste their lives away is unfathomable. Don’t get me wrong, I love technology! Why do you think I’m pursuing a career in web development? But with that said, I think the use of technology, games, texting ,etc. should all be used with discernment and moderation. You might be thinking, “But Chris, this just a result of human addiction. This isn’t a problem with technology itself”. I agree, a lot of the problems are on the users end, but developers also have the ability to prevent users from being attached.></p>
      <p class="paragraph">As an aspiring developer, I want to be able to create something that’ll make an improvement on everyday life. Whether it’s an application that will bring more fun and enjoyment or an application that increases productivity, I want my product to be able to improve the user’s life. At the same time, I don’t want my users to be on my application 24/7 wasting their precious lives away. As an aspiring developer, I feel like it’s the developer’s responsibility to put safeguards on their product in order to prevent its users to dumping hours and hours of their life on it. It’s extremely common to see families and groups of friends at restaurants all using their phones. It’s also extremely common to get requests from family and friends for additional lives so they can keep playing Candy Crush. Developers should the issue of addiction into consideration when developing their products. Developers should care about how its users are spending their time and how it affects their lives.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">I have the deepest respect for Dong Nguyen, the creator of Flappy Bird. He removed his game from the Apple App Store and Google Play after learning about it’s addictive nature. If you have never heard of Flappy Bird, consider yourself lucky. Flappy Bird was a simple game where the player would control a small bird. The objective was to fly between rows of green pipes without hitting them. Believe it or not, this game had an extremely addictive nature. My classmates would constantly play during lecture and my coworkers would be playing for a new high score during their lunch hour. This highly addicting game generated over $50k of ad revenue alone. He believed that people shouldn’t be spending that much time playing a game on their phones, so he removed the app.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">This may not be a pressing issue like software security or plagiarizing code, but this is something I found important. Addiction and attachment to technology is real and it is not something people realize. People don’t realize they’re just staring into their phones when they’re out with friends. They don’t realize they’re missing out on the social interaction. Developers need to understand the affect their applications have on users. </p>
      <p class="paragraph">This is a funny Kickstarter I found related to this issue: <a href= "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nophone-usa/nophone-0"> No Phone </a></p>
