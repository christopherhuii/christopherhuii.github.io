      <h1 id="blog-title">Blog #15: Conflict Resolution</h1>
      <p id="blog-date">10/17/2014<br>3:51 PM</p>
      <p class="paragraph">For this blog, I will be discussing an emotional conflict I had with another person. For the sake of structure, I will go down and answer each question one by one.</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>1. Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">Back in college, conflicts with roommates were inevitable. There was a time I was trying to get some sleep, but my roommate had the nerve to joke around with me trying to sleep. I’m pretty tolerant of pranks and joking around, but his insensitivity towards my sleep pushed me over the limit.He started knocking on the table/bed in order to bother me so I wouldn’t be able to sleep. I asked him several times to stop, but he didn’t get the hint. It got to a point where I snapped and physically attacked him. It could and would have ended worse for him if he had not been my friend.</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>2. What was the source of the conflict?</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">The source of the conflict was his disrespect of my personal space/sleep. He intentionally tried to annoy me.</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>3. How did you handle that conflict?</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">My first attempt to handle the conflict was to be civil and use words. I calmly asked him to stop what he was doing to let me sleep. He didn’t stop so I acted more physically and even then he didn’t stop. After I got back into bed he continued for a little while longer, but I ignored him and he eventually stopped.</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>4. Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">My actions didn’t have an effect on the situation. I don’t think he took anything I did seriously, so he didn’t stop what he was doing.</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>5. If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">Going back, I probably wouldn’t do anything differently. If anything, I probably would have ignored him for a little bit and see if he would stop annoying me.</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>6. What did you learn from this experience?</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">I learned that if people just want to be annoying, they’re going to be annoying. Nothing I do is going to stop them from being annoying if they know that they are successful at being annoying. I hope that sentence made some sense. </p>
