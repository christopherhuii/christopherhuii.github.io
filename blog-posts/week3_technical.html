      <h1 id="blog-title">Blog #4: JavaScript in Web Development</h1>
      <p id="blog-date">9/12/2014<br>1:40 PM</p>
      <p class="paragraph">As some of you may know, I have only been learning to program for about two months now. One of the most confusing things I ran into while starting up, was figuring out what language I wanted to learn first. There are so many different languages out there that I didn’t even know where to start. Some websites would push me towards one language, while another website would nudge me towards another language. Long story short, the first language I <em>tried</em> to learn was JavaScript. After consulting numerous resources, the general consensus I received was that I would be better off learning JavaScript first and move on from there. </p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>Why is JavaScript popular in web development?</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">This was the same question I asked myself when I first started learning JavaScript. I curious about why people were so adamant about learning JavaScript. Why is it so important to learn? What makes it so popular. After using JavaScript and doing an abundant amount of research, I finally understand why JavaScript is so popular in web development.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The first (and probably best) reason JavaScript is so popular is that it is incredible easy to learn and easy to use. JavaScript was the first thing I learned and it kept me wanting to learn more. That basically means JavaScript wasn’t too frustrating when I first started learning. It was relatively easy to understand and none of it’s syntax was overwhelming for me to comprehend. But of course, just because it was easy to learn doesn’t mean it’s a simple language. I still consider myself a beginner in JavaScript and I practice it everyday in order to hone and solidify my skills. </p>
      <p class="paragraph">In addition to that, Javascript is installed on every modern web browser. That means no additional problems with installations of software. This makes it easier for developers to start programming immediately on their browsers. JavaScript was first integrated with Netscape Navigator and has been on most web browsers since. JavaScript also works seamlessly with HTML/CSS. Another reason why JavaScript is so widely used is because JavaScript is <em>fast</em>. All the code is executed on the client’s side rather than a server. This means processing will be quicker, thus making Javascript a fast language.</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>What are JavaScript’s limitations?</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">Nothing is perfect in this world. I’m pretty sure this is something everyone can agree on. While JavaScript is a powerful language, it is not perfect. Javascript does have it’s strengths, but it also has it’s limitations. </p>
      <p class="paragraph">JavaScript is most criticized for it’s inability to be reliable and consistent across different browsers. Layouts render differently under different browsers. Scripts must be cross-tested across different browsers in order to be confident you will have a consistent output. This process of checking every browser’s output to ensure consistently can be tedious and time consuming to any web developer. </p>
      <p class="paragraph">There have also been concerns about JavaScript’s security issues. I am not completely familiar with these accusations, but people have disabled JavaScript on their browsers to avoid these issues. Because the code is completely client sided, users can be exploited, but malicious users. Again, I have not experienced any security issues, but from my research, it seems that people have experienced these claims and feel like they are a weakness to JavaScript. </p>
