      <p class="paragraph"><!--Insert one paragraph here-->After watching Shereef’s Fireside Chat, I felt more confident in my decision of attending Dev Bootcamp. It is evident that Shereef cares about the students’ success, not only at DBC, but in the working world as well. This means building up well-rounded people, rather than people who just write lines of code. To Shereef, creating a programming school isn’t just a form of income, but it is a way that he is able to share the goodness of technology and programming to people. This tenacity is engaged by a passion for his craft, rather than a passion for money. I am glad that I am learning from people that truly love programming. This was something I knew before coming into Dev Bootcamp, but watching this video further solidified my impression of Shereef and Dev Bootcamp. Ironically, something that scares me is their passion for programming. It scares me because they truly care about and love programming. This means higher expectations and less BS. If they feel like I’m not giving it my best, I could be removed from DBC. Other schools would gladly take my money and run without a second thought, but DBC seems to be more interested in training students to be successful web developers. I am excited to be a part of a culture that loves programming. I am excited to be surrounded by like minded people striving for the same goal. I am excited to learn, struggle, and succeed with my cohort in being web developers. But most of all, I am excited for all the new experiences and the new relationships I will form during my time at Dev Bootcamp!</p>
