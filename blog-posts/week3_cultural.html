      <h1 id="blog-title">Blog #5: Thoughts on Gregorc Thinkging Styles</h1>
      <p id="blog-date">9/12/2014<br>1:50 PM</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Prior to the start of Dev Bootcamp, students were instructed to assess their Gregorc Thinking Style. One thinking style isn’t necessarily supreme over all, but rather, the way you use your thinking style to approach a task can greatly determine your success. My thinking style was <strong> Concrete Sequential</strong> and <strong>Abstract Sequential</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">I am personally fascinated by research and statistics about psychological tendencies. I’ve always found them to be interesting and accurate. After the first three weeks of Dev Bootcamp’s Phase 0, I’ve realized the results from my thinking style test are <strong>spot on</strong>. I actually believed the test was accurate to begin with, but these past few weeks have further solidified my thinking style. </p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>Concrete Sequential</strong> minded people tend typically like, order, logical sequence, directions, and facts. Anybody that knows me can vouch for me and say those words describe me perfectly. Whenever working on challenges, I need order. I need structured lessons and some sort of guidance to be successful. As a concrete sequential thinker, my biggest weakness is working when there are unclear and incomplete instructions. Sometimes directions aren’t clear, and I make too many logical observations that pull me away from the actual tasks themselves. The most challenging part during Phase 0 thus far, are the solo challenges. The solo challenges at Dev Bootcamp don’t have much direction. The instructions tell you what needs to be done and leave it to you to experiment and try new things for yourself. As a concrete sequential minded person, I don’t like to experiment.  With the website solo challenge and the mission design solo challenge, I struggled greatly. The call for creativity was a major struggle for me.</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>Abstract Sequential</strong> was just also a thinking style that described me. As an abstract sequential thinker, I like to analyze the problem before I make a decision. I also like to apply logic when trying to create a solution to a problem. This personality trait has been extremely evident within the first few weeks at Dev Bootcamp. I have found it somewhat difficult to work with other because of these traits. Some of the pairs I have worked with liked to experiment and test out different lines of code. For me, I liked to have a logical answer first before I implemented the code into the webpage. Abstract Sequential thinkers also tend to learn best when they have access to experts or references. I found this true because I constantly used Google and other books as references to aid my learning. I learn more from learning from others rather than testing and figuring things out on my own. This proved to be somewhat of a struggle because I didn’t have teachers to consult on the spot. I needed to attempt to figure things out on my own. </p>
      <p class="paragraph">Phase 0 has been somewhat of a struggle because of my thinking style. The way I learn best isn’t really supported by a remote learning environment. However, just because my learning style is different, doesn’t mean that I just give up and quit. During this time, I have needed to adjust and adapt to the environment I am given. I have needed to work past my habits and not be afraid to face failure. Working on solo challenges with open ended instructions isn’t really something I prefer, but it forces me to enter a growth mindset and be encouraged by failure. I have found that working under different circumstances than we’re used to isn’t really a bad thing. It causes us to face and work past our weaknesses. It helps us to face failure and work past them instead of folding our cards. I have found that working in Dev Bootcamp has encouraged me to face my shortcomings to become a more well-rounded person. </p>
