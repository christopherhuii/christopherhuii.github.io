      <h1 id="blog-title">Blog #9: Paired Programming @ Dev Bootcamp</h1>
      <p id="blog-date">9/25/2014<br>5:33 PM</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Dev Bootcamp has a large emphasis on paired programming because it allows students to experience what they will all face in their careers as web developers. With that said, it is no surprise that Dev Bootcamp has their students pair <strong>at least</strong> twice a week as a part of the Phase 0 offsite curriculum. As you may remember in my About Me page or one of my previous posts, I have an Economics background and am very new to the technology/programming industry. Paired programming was something extremely foreign to me coming into Dev Bootcamp. All the programming experience I had prior to attending Dev Bootcamp consisted of me sitting in my room learning off Codecademy. Paired Programming was a new and unique experience for me as a beginner developer. </p>
      <p class="paragraph">Paired programming is scary, fun, frustrating, and rewarding. For me, pair programming is one of those things you love and hate. Pairing while solving a challenge is extremely helpful to my understanding. Two different people will almost always have different experiences and different ideas or approaches to solve a challenge. This is extremely helpful to one’s understanding of fundamental concepts of any language. Pairing is extremely rewarding because it allows a student to learn from their peers. I’ll be first to say that I don’t understand everything perfectly. Pairing has allowed other students to fill in the gaps in my understanding of some concepts. Other students have taken the time to make sure I understand all the concepts we are going through during the course of a challenge. Pairing also allows me to help other students with the learning competencies as well. This is rewarding because it allows me to help another student and it also helps me to solidify the concepts I already understand.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Up to now, pairing might seem all great and fun! It’s not. Pairing really sucks sometimes. Sometimes I really don’t want to pair, but I have to because it’s a part of the curriculum. This just depends on my overall mood during any day. Pairing can also be frustrating when your partner isn’t communicating effectively. There are also other times where your pair isn’t on the same page with you. There was one time where my partner was so fixed on his idea being better than my so he went ahead and implemented his idea. People come from all different sorts of backgrounds so it is extremely important that you are accommodating to all different types of people. There have been times where my partner was lightyears ahead of me in the learning competencies because they had previous programming experience. They ended up doing a lot of the driving and navigating and I was having a hard time following them. There has also been a time where my partner was behind in the curriculum. In that situation, my partner was having a hard time understanding me and I was having a hard time explaining myself to him. I’m sure there are other situations where pairing can be frustrating. I have only paired about a dozen times, so there is plenty of room for me to learn about the positive and negative attributes of pairing. </p>
      <p class="paragraph">Leaving feedback is also something Dev Bootcamp requires their students to do. In order to learn from your previous pairing sessions, Dev Bootcamp has their students leave feedback for their pair. This is helpful for me because it allows me to assess how I can improve when I approach a pairing session. It’s also good for my pair because I can let them know the positives and the negatives from my point of view. Feedback can be awkward, especially if the feedback is negative. Dev Bootcamp tells their student to leave the feedback anonymous, but it is really easy to tell who left you the feedback. Based on my pairing partners and challenges, I can instantly tell who left me which piece of feedback. It’s awkward because I don’t want to completely demolish a student with negative feedback because I know they will know I wrote it. Receiving feedback is helpful towards my understanding. Giving feedback is also rewarding because my intent for feedback is to let my partner know how they are doing and how they can improve.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Writing feedback can be difficult, especially if it is negative. I would never want to hurt somebody with my words. It is a challenge to be able to leave negative, but also kind feedback. It is also a challenge writing feedback in a specific way that won’t let the other person know who wrote it. There are times I don’t feel right critiquing another person because who am I do judge another person’s work? I am still a beginner programmer and I feel that I am not good enough assess another person’s work. Writing feedback is also challenging because it is hard to think of actionable feedback. Sometimes I don’t know what my partner can work on and I end up leaving that section blank. Writing feedback has a lot of benefit to it, but it can prove to be challenging to write.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Overall, pairing and feedback is a good system for a students’ learning. Obviously, it is not perfect, but I think that its positive attributes outweigh its negative attributes. Paired Programming allows new to learn from others and others to learn from me. I personally prefer it because it allows like-minded people to work together in order to achieve a common goal. So pair program on!</p>
