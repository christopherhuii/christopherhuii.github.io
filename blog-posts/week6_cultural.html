      <h1 id="blog-title">Blog #11: Stereotype Threat</h1>
      <p id="blog-date">10/3/2014<br>12:48AM</p>
      <p class="paragraph">From the research conducted by Steele and Aronson in 1995, <strong>Stereotype threat</strong> refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one’s group. I can’t say with full confidence that my underachievement is a result of the stereotype theory, but after careful thought, it could be a possibility. I’m not really sure if these are <em>negative</em> stereotypes for my group, but I will go ahead and plead my case. I identify with the Asian-American group and there are some stereotypes that I feel could hinder my success.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">I hope I don’t rub off with a complaining nature while writing this blog. I am happy with who I am and am in no way suggesting that I have things bad. I also really hope I don’t sound petty.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">As a 22 year old Asian-American citizen, I think one of the biggest challenges I face is my appearance. I look young. I look like a 14 year old kid beginning his Freshman year in high school. I have a scrawny build. I have incredibly small facial features. I can’t grow any facial hair. This might sound petty, but it’s a struggle looking young. People’s first impression are based off how somebody looks. It’s an immediate uphill battle because I look young. There is an automatic assumption that because I’m young that I don’t know as much or I do not have enough experience. People look down upon my youth because they don’t think I am capable of fulfilling a job. </p>
      <p class="paragraph">Over the past 6 months, I felt this way in numerous job interviews. I’m probably not the most qualified job candidate, but there have been times where I felt I wasn’t even given a chance during the interview. It seemed like the interviewer was trying his/her hardest to get through it as fast as possible. It’s hard to be taken seriously by somebody older than you if you look like you’re 14. I can’t say for sure it was because I looked young, but it definitely felt that way. How can I compete for a job if I’m already dismissed at first look? Like I said before, first impressions are a big deal.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">It also affects me psychologically. Before I meet new people, I am fully aware of how I look and how it might affect the way they treat me. It’s always in the back of my head whether people are judging me based on how young I look. I have this weird sense of detecting eyes on me. There have been numerous occasions at Total Wine where an employee came up to me to form some sort of small talk. I can’t say this for sure, but I feel like they don’t think I’m 21. They’re looking to make sure I’m not sneaking around the store as an underaged kid. It just feels like the odds are stacked against you when you’re judged at first glance. </p>
      <p class="paragraph">I probably sound like a huge drama queen right now. To be honest, it doesn’t affect me anymore as much as it might seem. Initially, it was something tough to deal with. Now that I understand it, the only way I can overcome this stereotype is to prove everyone wrong. I will probably always look young. I’m probably going to look young during my first interview post-DBC. It’s up to me to show my future employer that I am capable of building applications that will be profitable for the company. </p>
      <p class="paragraph">I’m running pretty close to the time-box limit so I’ll just leave this blog post here. Sorry if my thoughts aren't coherent and are a little jumbled up. I wish I had more time to really focus, organize my thoughts, and relay what I need to say coherently. Until next time!</p>
      <p class="paragraph">BTW, I’m a pretty <strong>damn good</strong> driver :)</p>
