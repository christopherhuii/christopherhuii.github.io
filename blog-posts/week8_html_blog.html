      <p class="paragraph">During Dev Bootcamp’s Phase 0, students were required to blog at least twice a week. One blog post was devoted to technical topics and the other post was devoted to cultural topics chosen by Dev Bootcamp. Our blogs and blog websites were designed early on during Unit 1 of Phase 0, so our HTML/CSS skills were pretty rough in the beginning. Now that I’ve been blogging for over 7 weeks now, I have learned some new skills and found some weaknesses in my knowledge. </p>
      <p class="paragraph">I found that blogging helped supplement my technical skills. The technical blog often required me to do extra reading and research on coding topics. It made sure I understood the topics to a level where I could translate my thoughts into sentences. Often times it was difficult to time box my blog posts to an hour. The research alone took a significant amount of time and putting that knowledge into words took a while as well. Blogging helped challenge me in a different way writing code does. Writing the actual code helps me understand how code is used, but blogging helps me understand what the code is doing and how it can be used differently. Hopefully that makes sense. Blogging allowed me to have a deeper understand of the code I was writing.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">When I revisited my blog page, I knew what the page looked like. I knew that it was very basic because I made it during the earlier weeks of Phase 0. Over the past 7 weeks of blogging, I never noticed how plain and simple the page was. I was numbed by the characteristics of the page. Getting feedback from my friends helped me to see what can be improved on my page. They helped point out obvious flaws that I was numb to because I had been using the page for so long. Hearing the feedback was constructive and helped me think of ideas on how I could improve the page. </p>
      <p class="paragraph">Unfortunately, those ideas were difficult to implement because my lack of practice in HTML/CSS. During Phase 0, we jumped from from HTML/CSS, to JavaScript, to Ruby, and lastly onto SQL. These weeks during Phase 0 greatly improved my technical skills, but my HTML/CSS skills have had little improvement after Unit 1. This made implementing changes difficult, because I was not refining those skills throughout the weeks. I was focused on the tasks that were in front of me. With that said, that made the process of this challenge difficult. I am not finished with these changes to my website and will not be anytime soon. I see this project as a work in progress that will continue even after graduation from Dev Bootcamp. I hope that I was able to improve my website/blog to the best of my ability to satisfy this challenge.</p>
