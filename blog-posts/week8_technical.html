      <h1 id="blog-title">Blog #16: What is Rails?</h1>
      <p id="blog-date">10/17/2014<br>4:04 PM</p>
      <p class="paragraph">This is a question I have been asking myself throughout Dev Bootcamp’s Phase 0. I know there is something known as ‘Ruby on Rails’, but I don’t know what ‘Rails’ is. During Unit 2 of Phase 0, we spend a lot of time learning about Ruby, but there was no sign of Rails. I still have not touched Rails, so I’m going to give it my best shot explaining Rails without any previous experience.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Rails is a software library that makes Ruby a more versatile language. Rails was created to extend the Ruby programming language. Rails is a framework that is used for building websites. Rails combines Ruby with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to create functional web applications. By doing this, Rails makes it easier to collaborate and maintain web applications. Rails is great because it allows programmers to accomplish more while writing less code.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">I’m not sure what else to write. I could regurgitate information I found off a website, but I found father explain concepts I understand. This is a challenging thing to do because I have no experience using Rails. So I guess this is the end to my shortest blog post!</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong> I will be researching and learning about the other topics, but I will not physically write about them</strong></p>
