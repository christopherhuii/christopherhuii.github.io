      GPS 1.1: Pair Programming

      <ul>What is Pair Programming?
        <li>Pair Programming is when two people are working together on the same line of code. </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>Why is Pair Programming important to DBC?
        <li>Pair Programming is important to DBC because it simulates the work environment many students will face at their future careers as web developers. Within a "pair", there is a 'driver' and a 'navigator'. Pair Programming helps both people to learn from each other and develops communication skills between the two partners. Pair Programming also helps reduce the number of mistakes because they are both looking at the same document. Working with a peer also helps both people stay focused on a task, rather than being distracted by surrounding factors. </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>What is a Driver?  What is a Navigator?
        <li>In Pair Programming, there are two roles: a <strong>driver</strong> and a <strong>navigator</strong>. </li>

        <li>A <strong>driver</strong> is the person who is actively typing on the keyboard. He is the one who is making changes in the text editor.</li>
        <li>A <strong>navigator</strong> is the person who is instructing the driver what to add and change in the text editor. The navigator has the "big picture" overview of the project, while the driver is mainly focused on the instructions of the navigator.  The navigator's role is also to check for errors in syntax and thinking of better ways to structure the code.</li>

      Reflection
    <p>This wasn’t my first Peer Pairing, but it was my first GPS. I had paired with somebody before on another challenge. It was a good experience. I learned something new from my peer immediately after the pairing session started! In my last pairing, I think I struggled a bit with navigating. I wasn’t very specific with my previous partner so my directions were very vague.  For this GPS, I did a better job navigating and correcting my partner’s mistakes. I thought that we did a pretty good job. One issue we ran into was the concept of the “children” inheriting different stylings from their parent. That was something challenging because we couldn’t figure out how to prevent a “child” from inheriting the styling. Having an instructor there was a little nerve-racking only because I was worried about looking dumb or doing something wrong. I soon realized that he was there to help and the instructors understand that many students are beginners. Overall, it was a good experience and I hope to continue to learn through these experiences. </p>
