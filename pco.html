                  <h1>about me</h1>
                  <p>my name is christopher and i was born and raised in sunny los angeles, california. i studied economics/administrative studies at the university of california, riverisde (ucr). during the transition period after college, i started playing this iphone game called 'flappy bird'. the game had a simple concept and simple graphics, but yet it kept me hooked. i thought to myself, "how hard could it be to build something as simple as 'flappy bird'?" and that's how i was exposed to the world of programming.</p>

                  <h1>programming experience</h1>
                  <p>my journey into web development began at dev bootcamp. at dev bootamp, i learned a lot of technical competencies including but not limited to: ruby, rails, javascript, and html/css. in addition to that, dev bootcamp had curriculum called "engineering empathy", where i learned how to show empathy, how to be a good teammate while pair programming, as well as being a better overall person. needless to say, dev bootcamp taught me what is required of a developer technically and culturally.</p>
                  <p>
                    my first gig came as a contract front end developer for a local creative design company. most of my responsibilities involved implementing designers' mockups. however, i gained a lot of insight on implementing user-friendly design and paying attention to the finer details, independent of a designer's guidance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    currently, i am working at a .NET shop doing front end development. we are leveraging react, flux, and typescript for client side development. i have the responsibilities of building reusable components, implementing user friendly features, and maintaining consistent branding across applications.

                <p>
                  as a servant of jesus christ, i believe it is an wonderful privilege to use your vocation to serve christ and his church. working at pco would allow me to use my skill sets to develop products that help churches care for their ministries and people. working for a company that has a product i care about will ultimately keep me motivated and excited to come into work everyday. in addition to that, working in a collaborative workspace, learning from talented teammates, and all the bells and whistles are icing on the cake!
