                  <h1>about me</h1>
                  <p>my name is christopher and i was born and raised in sunny los angeles, california. i studied economics/administrative studies at the university of california, riverisde (ucr) and graduated in december 2013. i really enjoyed studying economics because everything felt somewhat practical. topics like supply and demand, market trends, and investments were all topics that i really took interest in. to be honest, if there's money or dollar signs involved, i'll be interested! however, it was pretty difficult to find a career with my degree because i felt that i could not keep up with the cut throat lifestyle. during transition period after college, i started playing this iphone game called 'flappy bird'. the game had a simple concept and simple graphics, but yet it kept me hooked. a few days later, i found out it generated a ridiculous amount of cash flow. (like i said, all it takes is money to get me interested!) i thought to myself, 'how hard could it be to build something as simple as 'flappy bird?' that's how i was exposed to the world of programming.</p>

                  <h1>programming experience</h1>
                  <p>since i was transitioning from college life to career life, i had plenty of down time to spend. i figured i should keep myself occupied instead of wasting my life away. i started programming learning using codecademy. i was fascinated at the fact that i could build things from my personal computer that could be hosted on the internet. i found out that one of my friends from college was doing one of these '12 week coding schools' in sf. i had my doubts, but i did my research and was convinced of the success students were having. i applied and was admitted into dev bootcamp sf. when starting dev bootcamp, i had around 2 weeks of experience. it was scary, but i was determined to make the most of the experience! dev bootcamp focuses mainly on ruby and teaches students how to use sinatra and rails as frameworks. along the way, we incorporated html/css, bootstrap, javascript and its frameworks into our projects. a ton of technical curriculum was packed into those short 9 weeks, but i also learned a lot culturally. i learned how to show empathy and how to be a good teammate, whether through pair programming or working on a group project. needless to say, dev bootcamp taught me a lot technically and culturally.</p>

                <h1>why MX?</h1>
                <p>having a background in economics, my preference is to work for a fintech company. things with $$$ are exponentially more interesting to me! on top of that, budgeting and handling money is something that i am very passionate about. i budget all my money and have all my money accounted for. it's something i enjoy doing and it's something i encourage all my friends to do.</p>
                <p>i have realized that programming is a difficult thing and that's why i'm interested in this apprenticeship. i'm interested in continuing my learning about technology and best practices alongside more experienced engineers. i don't have a ton of experience under my belt and this is the perfect time for me to learn and strengthen my problem solving skills without the stress of being a core member of an engineering team. i want to be challenged, but also know that there are other engineers that can lend a hand when i've hit a wall. also, the culture at MX looks awesome! from what i could tell, there's a lot to be desired at MX (especially that dope spray paint mural). being able to work for a fintech company like MX would definitely be a homerun swing!</p>

                <p>i've seen 'the office' 7 times in its entirety and am always up for some 'the office' trivia.</p>
                <p>i enjoy working with my hands. when i'm not programming, i cut beer bottles to make tumbler and shot glasses. i'm trying to get into wood work as well!</p>
