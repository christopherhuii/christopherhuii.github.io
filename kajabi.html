                  <h1>about me</h1>
                  <p>my name is christopher and i was born and raised in sunny los angeles, california. i studied economics/administrative studies at the university of california, riverisde (ucr) and graduated in december 2013. while topics like supply and demand, market trends, and investments were all topics that i really took interest in, it was pretty difficult to find a career within finance because i felt that i could not keep up with the cut throat lifestyle. during transition period after college, i started playing this iphone game called 'flappy bird'. the game had a simple concept and simple graphics, but yet it kept me hooked. i thought to myself, "how hard could it be to build something as simple as 'flappy bird'?" and that's how i was exposed to the world of programming.</p>

                  <h1>programming experience</h1>
                  <p>since i was transitioning from college life to career life, i had plenty of down time to spend learning how to program. i started programming using codecademy. i was fascinated at the fact that i could build things from my personal computer that could be hosted on the internet. i was interested in learning more about programming and ended up attending dev bootcamp sf. dev bootcamp focuses mainly on ruby and teaches students how to use sinatra and rails as frameworks. along the way, we incorporated html/css, bootstrap, javascript and its frameworks into our projects. a ton of technical curriculum was packed into those short 9 weeks, but i also learned a lot culturally. i learned how to show empathy and how to be a good teammate, whether through pair programming or working on a group project. needless to say, dev bootcamp taught me what is required of a software engineer technically and culturally.</p>

                <p>one of the things i am most excited about working at kajabi is creating software that is geared towards the user's needs. it's great to see that kajabi has taken the intiative to reiterate on their product to better fulfill the customer's needs. i am also excited to be involved and working alongside a team of awesome people. just by watching the kajaabi team videos and looking at the job page, i can tell that kajabi has amazing company culture and values its employees. and most of all, i'm excited to learn more about programming and growing as a developer. i'm a relatively new developer and i'm looking forward to learn more through creating and defining a product!</p>
