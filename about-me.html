      <li>My name is Christopher Hui and I am a student at Dev Bootcamp learning to be a web developer. In December 2013, I graduated the University of California, Riverside with a B.A. in Economics/Administrative Studies and a concentration in Finance. I had a job within the automotive industry, but I did not see myself growing into the position I had, so I left the company. After months of arduously searching for a job related to my college degree, I thought it was time to begin considering other career paths. That's how I found web development. I started off learning off of Codecademy not expecting much, but I quickly learned how interesting and fun programming could be. I knew this could be the beginning of a new career, so I began to start looking into schools. It's funny, because I had no idea programming bootcamps existed, until one day I was looking on Twitter and saw a Dev Bootcamp advertisement/sponsership. I considered many different programs, but Dev Bootcamp stood out to me the most. I applied, got in, and I have now started class!</li>
      <li> It's funny where life guides us. I entered college in pursuit of a career in the financial industry, looking forward to the end goal of being financially successful. I never considered everything that happens along the way from point A to point B. Now, I'm not just focused on graduating Dev Bootcamp to become a web developer, but rather, I'm looking forward to all the experiences throughout the journey of becoming a web developer!</li>
